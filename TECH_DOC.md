🛍️ MERN E-Commerce Website
A full-stack MERN e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, view detailed pages, and manage a shopping cart. Built with React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas, featuring a responsive UI, RESTful APIs, and basic state management for a seamless shopping experience.

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) architecture for building an online shopping platform where users can:

View all available products

Check detailed product information

Add or remove products from the shopping cart

View total cost and manage items in cart

🧠 Data Model Example
products

json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "name": "Classic Hoodie",
  "price": 799,
  "description": "Soft and comfortable cotton hoodie",
  "image": "https://example.com/hoodie.jpg",
  "stock": 25
}
🛠️ API Routes
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Fetch all products
GET	/api/products/:id	Fetch a single product by ID

🧩 State Management
Context API is used to manage the cart state.

Actions include: ADD, REMOVE, CLEAR.

Cart data is temporary and resets on refresh (can be extended to localStorage).
